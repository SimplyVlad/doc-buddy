7_0,7,0,"Normal Aortic Anatomy
The aorta is the largest artery in the body and can be 
divided into 5 main anatomic segments (Figure 1): the 
root or sinus segment, which extends from the aortic 
valve annulus to the sinotubular junction; the ascend-
ing thoracic aorta, which extends from the sinotubular 
junction to the innominate artery; the aortic arch, which 
extends from the innominate to the left subclavian artery; 
the descending thoracic aorta, which extends from the 
left subclavian artery to the diaphragm; and the abdomi-
nal aorta, which extends from the diaphragm to the level 
of the aortic bifurcation. The aortic wall is composed of 3 layers (Figure 2): a 
thin inner intima, a thicker central media, and a thin outer 
adventitia. The intima consists of a layer of endothelial 
cells within a matrix of connective tissue. The media 
consists of smooth muscle cells, elastic fibers, collagen 
proteins, and polysaccharides sandwiched in >50 layers 
known as elastic lamellae. The media provides strength and distensibility to the aorta, features that are critical to 
circulatory function. The adventitia is composed of con-
nective tissue, fibroblasts, nerves, and the vasa vasorum, 
which perfuse the outer aortic wall and a substantial por-
tion of the media. Aortic Landing Zones
In addition to the standard anatomic descriptors of the 
aortic anatomy, there is a more technical classification of 
aortic anatomy that is used to plan, guide, and report aor-
tic interventions, especially endovascular stent-grafting."

8_0,8,0,"Definitions of Dilation and Aneurysm of the 
Aortic Root and Ascending Thoracic Aorta
The conventional definition of an arterial aneurysm is any 
artery that is dilated to at least 1.5 times its expected 
normal diameter.3 This definition applies well to the 
abdominal and descending thoracic aorta. However, it 
has long been recognized that this definition fails when 
it comes to defining aneurysms of the aortic root and 
ascending thoracic aorta. For example, a man in his 40s 
would be expected to have an average aortic root diam-
eter of 3.5 cm; applying the standard definition of ≥1.5 
times reference diameter, his aortic root would have to 
reach 5.25 cm before it would be considered an aneu-
rysm, whereas most experts would consider his aorta to be an aneurysm well below that diameter. Indeed, if this 
patient had Marfan syndrome or a familial thoracic aor-
tic aneurysm, aortic repair would be recommended at a 
diameter of ≤5.0 cm, a size that would not even be large 
enough to be termed an “aneurysm.”
The most important consideration in deciding the 
diameter thresholds at which to call the root and ascend-
ing aorta dilated or aneurysmal is based on the natural 
history of such abnormal aortas."

201 patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) undergo-
ing aortic valve replacement (AVR) (those undergoing 
concomitant replacement of the ascending aorta were 
excluded) and followed them for 10 to 15 years; they 
found that those with baseline aortic diameters of 4.5 cm 
to 4.9 cm had a significantly increased risk of aneurysm, Table 2. Applying American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Class of Recommendation and Level of Evidence to

those with diameters <4.5 cm (Figure 4). To evaluate the risk of type A aortic dissection at various 
diameters below the traditional 5.5 cm threshold for pro-
phylactic aortic repair, Paruchuri et al5 plotted a distribu-
tion curve of ascending aortic size in a community sample 
from the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) database. They then analyzed the number of dissections 
(numerator) at each aortic diameter and the population at 
risk at each aortic diameter (denominator). They found that, 
relative to a control aortic diameter of ≤ 3.4 cm, a diameter 
of 4.0 cm to 4.4 cm conferred an 89-fold increased risk of 
dissection, and a diameter of ≥ 4.5 cm conferred a 6000-
fold increased risk (Figure 5), albeit these are only relative

that the increase in risk at 4.0 cm to 4.4 cm justifies defin-
ing an aorta of this size “dilated,” and the abrupt increase 
in risk at a diameter of ≥ 4.5 cm justifies defining an aorta 
of this size as an “aneurysm.” Using this approach, of the 
subjects in the MESA database, only 2.6% would be con-
sidered to have a dilated aorta and only 0.2% to have an 
aneurysm. This definition of a dilated ascending aorta being ≥4.0 
cm is consistent with what was proposed in the 2014 
European Society of Cardiology guidelines on the diag-
nosis and treatment of aortic diseases, in which aortic 
“dilation” was similarly defined as an aorta diameter of 
>4.0 cm.6
Finally, in the clinical setting, the term “dilation” is 
preferred to “ectasia” to describe mild aortic enlarge-
ment. Historically, there has been a lack of uniformity in 
the use of “ectasia” in image interpretation. Many radi-
ologists use “ectatic” rather than “dilated” to describe 
a mildly enlarged aorta, whereas others use “ectatic” 
to describe an abnormal aortic shape, such as a “tor-
tuous” aorta.7 Even more problematic is the fact that 
some imaging groups use the term “ectasia” to describe 
larger aortas, such as those 4.5 cm to 5.4 cm in diam-
eter,8 which overlaps with what most experts would 
consider to be an aneurysm."

The z-score is routinely used to assess aortic dilation 
in the pediatric population, as changes in a child’s age 
and body size make it especially challenging to define 
normal aortic size and to distinguish normal from patho-
logic aortic growth. Nomograms have been established correlating BSA and aortic root diameter to generate 
the z-score. One limitation of the reliance on BSA is that

Davies et al11 showed that aortic size index (ASI), which is

dictor of adverse aortic events than diameter alone, and 
that a simple nomogram could be used to stratify those 
with aortic aneurysms into low-, medium-, and high-risk 
groups. However, it is unclear whether the weight of an 
adult has a significant impact on the expected normal 
aortic diameter, and one would not expect a patient’s 
aorta to grow or shrink with significant fluctuations in 
weight. Zafar et al12 therefore examined whether aortic

allows the blood to pass through the tear and into the 
aortic media, splitting the intima in 2 longitudinally, cre-
ating a dissection flap that divides the true lumen from 
a newly formed false lumen (Figure 6). The dissection 
flap can propagate in an antegrade or retrograde fashion 
and lead to a number of life-threatening complications, 
including acute aortic regurgitation (AR), myocardial 
ischemia, cardiac tamponade, acute stroke, or malperfu-
sion syndromes. The blood surging in the false lumen

intima allows blood to penetrate the aortic 
media, pushing the dissection flap into 
the middle of the aorta, separating the

hematoma, blood leaks into the aortic 
media at low pressure, forming a thrombus 
that pushes the outer wall of the aorta 
outward, leaving a relatively normal

There are 2 commonly used anatomic classification sys-

tem and the Stanford system. The DeBakey system categorizes dissections into 
types I, II, and III, based on the origin of the intimal tear 
and the extent of the dissection:
● T ype I: Dissection tear originates in the ascending 
aorta and propagates distally to include the aortic 
arch and typically the descending aorta
● T ype II: Dissection tear is confined only to the 
ascending aorta
● T ype III: Dissection tear originates in the descend-
ing thoracic aorta and propagates most often 
distally
○ T ype IIIa: Dissection tear is confined only to the 
descending thoracic aorta
○ T ype IIIb: Dissection tear originates in the 
descending thoracic aorta and extends below 
the diaphragm
The Stanford classification system divides dissections 
into 2 categories according to whether the ascending 
aorta is involved or not, regardless of the site of origin:

2.4.1.2. Classification
There are 2 commonly used anatomic classification sys-
tems for aortic dissection (Figure 7): the DeBakey sys-
tem and the Stanford system. The DeBakey system categorizes dissections into 
types I, II, and III, based on the origin of the intimal tear 
and the extent of the dissection:
● T ype I: Dissection tear originates in the ascending 
aorta and propagates distally to include the aortic 
arch and typically the descending aorta
● T ype II: Dissection tear is confined only to the 
ascending aorta
● T ype III: Dissection tear originates in the descend-
ing thoracic aorta and propagates most often 
distally
○ T ype IIIa: Dissection tear is confined only to the 
descending thoracic aorta
○ T ype IIIb: Dissection tear originates in the 
descending thoracic aorta and extends below 
the diaphragm
The Stanford classification system divides dissections 
into 2 categories according to whether the ascending 
aorta is involved or not, regardless of the site of origin:
● T ype A: All dissections involving the ascending 
aorta, irrespective of the site of the intimal tear
● T ype B: All dissections that do not involve the 
ascending aorta (including dissections that involve 
the aortic arch but spare the ascending aorta)

Malperfusion syndrome occurs when there is end-organ 
ischemia related to inadequate perfusion of the aortic 
branch vessels. The relationship of the true and false 
lumens in an aortic dissection has a critical role in main-
taining stable perfusion of end-organs. Initially, the true 
lumen collapses because of the loss of transmural pres-
sure across the dissection flap and the subsequent elas-
tic recoil of the medial smooth muscle. Simultaneously, 
the false lumen expands immediately because of reduced 
elastic recoil, depth of the dissection plane within the

AND GUIDELINESAny of the aortic branches are at risk for malperfusion as 
the false lumen expands and compresses the true lumen 
and can occur in multiple vascular beds simultaneously 
as the dissection propagates distally. Dynamic obstruc-
tion occurs when the septum of the dissected intima pro-
lapses across into the ostia of a branch, usually during 
systole, thereby not allowing adequate flow to perfuse 
the vessel (Figure 9). When the dissection tear extends into 
the vessel proper and creates a stenosis or thrombosis in 
the artery, static obstruction occurs (Figure 9). Intramural Hematoma

layer of the aortic wall in the absence of an overt inti-
mal tear or patent false lumen. The blood may arise

Aneurysm (TAAA)
When descending thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) 
extend into the abdominal aorta, they are referred to as 
thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA). The Craw-
ford classification of TAAA, later modified by Safi et al1 
(Figure 10), not only describes the extent of an aneu-
rysm but also may predict the morbidity and mortality 
associated with aneurysm repair.2
2.6. Classification of Endoleaks
Endovascular stent-grafting is widely used in the repair of 
aortic aneurysms. One of the limitations of endografting is 
the occurrence of endoleaks, either early or late following 
the procedure. There are 5 types of endoleaks, as detailed 
in Figure 11. An endoleak results in the persistence of blood flow outside the graft and within the aneurysm 
sac, preventing its complete thrombosis. Consequently, 
patients with endografts require lifelong surveillance imag-
ing to monitor for the appearance of endoleaks.1

it is recommended that the root and ascending 
aortic diameters be measured from inner-edge 
to inner-edge, using an electrocardiographic-
synchronized technique. If there are aortic 
wall abnormalities, such as atherosclerosis or 
discrete wall thickening (more common in the 
distal aorta), the outer-edge to outer-edge 
diameter should be reported (Table 4). In patients with known or suspected aortic 
disease, the aortic root diameter should be 
recorded as maximum sinus to sinus mea-
surement. In the setting of known asymmetry, 
multiple measurements should be reported, 
and both short- and long-axis images of the 
root should be obtained to avoid underestima-
tion of the diameter. In patients with known or suspected aortic 
disease, it is reasonable that a dilated root or 
ascending aorta be indexed to patient height 
or BSA in the report, to aid in clinical risk 
assessment.8-11

tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesoph-

ultrasound all have important roles in these evaluations 
(Table 5). Selection of an imaging modality may be based 
on patient-specific factors, including hemodynamic sta-
bility, contrast allergy, renal function, and patient toler-
ance (eg, given relatively longer examination times and 
the confined space associated with MRI, occasionally 
requiring sedation). The institutional availability of an 
imaging modality or an expert imaging physician may 
also direct modality selection. The ubiquity of CT scan-
ners, combined with rapid acquisition of intuitive, high-
resolution 3-dimensional (3D) imaging data sets, has led 
to the wide adoption of this modality for the assessment 
of suspected aortic pathology and for periprocedural

3.2. Conventions of Measurements
Reproducible and accurate measurements of the aorta 
are critical for characterizing aortic disease and guiding 
treatment decisions. Measurements should be obtained 
perpendicular to the long axis of the aorta at specified 
segmental locations (Figure 13),1 with measurements 
also taken at the location of any abnormality. Unfortu-
nately, there is no widely accepted standard for aortic 
diameter measurements (eg, inner-edge to inner-edge, 
outer-edge to outer-edge) across imaging modalities. There is a wealth of historical data regarding using TTE 
to measure the aortic root (at end-diastole) from the 
leading-edge of the anterior wall to the leading-edge of 
the posterior wall, thus identifying the largest diameter.2,3 
These data allowed for the creation of normal limits 
adjusted for age, sex, and body size4 and provided insight 
regarding the prevalence and prognostic importance of 
aortic dilation."

with acute aortic dissection. In a retrospective 
review of 232 patients with acute type A aortic 
dissection who underwent urgent surgery in a

mortality rate was significantly lower among those 
operated on by a surgeon with aortic expertise 
versus a nonaortic expert, at 10% versus 26%, 
respectively (P =0.02). Moreover, aortic special-
ists performed aortic root procedures significantly 
more often (43.0% versus 17 .3%; P =0.001), 
and their cross-clamp times were significantly 
shorter.5 Finally, Umana-Pizano et al10 found that 
the mortality rate of acute type A aortic dissection

low-volume surgeons, respectively. Clearly not all 
patients with thoracic aortic disease (TAD) can be 
treated by Multidisciplinary Aortic Teams, espe-
cially in the setting of AAS. Nevertheless, when 
patients are referred for elective aortic interven-
tion, especially at aortic diameter thresholds that 
are borderline, the lower surgical mortality rate 
with expert aortic surgeons at high-volume cen-
ters may justify early aortic repair. Similarly, when

AND GUIDELINESand treatment options.1 Shared decision-making is espe-
cially useful when considering the diameter thresholds 
for and the timing of intervention in addition to having an 
important role in considering the risks of pregnancy in 
patients with underlying aortic disease. Shared decision-making is an active process in 
which patients and families are encouraged to 
share their values and preferences regarding qual-
ity of life, goals of care, and desired procedural 
outcomes. Formally recognizing those prefer-
ences helps physicians to better frame the risks 
and benefits of intervention versus conservative 
management. Actively involving patients in the 
decision-making process is especially important 
in situations in which there is clinical equipoise, 
such as: an aortic aneurysm with a diameter at the 
borderline of the threshold for repair; performing 
valve-sparing root repair rather than valved-conduit 
aortic root replacement; performing thoracic endo-
vascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in a patient with 
an uncomplicated type B aortic dissection who is 
at increased risk of complications; or treating an 
AAA with open surgical versus endovascular repair. Shared decision-making may be used for nonin-
terventional issues as well, such as the choice of 
medical therapies or the imaging modality used for 
surveillance. Shared decision-making has an important role 
in pregnancy among those with aortic disease 
to determine whether to consider conception, 
an appropriate diameter threshold for prophy-
lactic aortic repair, and the mode of delivery. This 
has particular relevance in patients with Marfan 
syndrome and Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and other 
heritable aortic disorders who are planning a 
pregnancy."

TAAs occur in 5 to 10 per 100 000 person years.1 The 
natural history and treatment vary depending on the 
cause and location of the TAA. The size of a given seg-

height, and body size.2 Aortic z-scores and other diam-
eter indexing methods (see Section 2.3, “Definitions of 
Dilation and Aneurysm of the Aortic Root and Ascend-
ing Thoracic Aorta”) may assist with risk assessment.3 Of 
all TAA, aneurysms of the aortic root, ascending aorta, 
or both are most common (∼60%), followed by those 
of the descending aorta (∼30%) and arch (<10%). Hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and heri-
table genetic variants are risk factors for TAA disease. Patients with TAA have a modestly increased incidence 
of AAA4 and cerebral aneurysms.5
Causes of TAA include heritable disorders, congeni-
tal conditions, multifactorial degenerative conditions, 
previous aortic dissection, inflammatory diseases, and 
infectious diseases (Table 6)."

should trigger gene-based management and cascade testing of at-risk relatives. When testing is negative or reveals variants of unknown significance, 
first-degree relatives should undergo screening aortic imaging. Modified with permission from Milewicz et al.6 Copyright 2021, Minerva Medica. Blue (+)

A major risk factor for aortic root aneurysms, ascend-
ing aortic aneurysms, and aortic dissection is a patho-
genic variant in genes predisposing to TAD. Although the 
recommendations focus on individuals at high risk for a 
single gene mutation (Table 8), genetic testing may have 
a role in many TAD patients. A multigene panel compris-
ing all genes suspected to cause HTAD is the most cost-
effective and clinically useful approach to testing. Only 
pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants are disease-
causing and should be used for cascade genetic test-
ing all relatives at risk for inheriting the disease-causing 
variant.15,16
In families with HTAD in which the causative gene 
has not been identified, the clinical features in affected 
family member should dictate management of other 
family members, including location of aneurysms; rel-
evant clinical features include the diameter of the aortic 
root and ascending aorta in affected family members 
who have had a type A dissection (noting that the aortic 
root typically is not distorted by the dissection, whereas 
the ascending aorta may acutely enlarge17) and other 
vascular disease or features segregating with TAA in 
the family. Current data indicate that 13% to 20% of 
patients with TAD and without Marfan syndrome 
or Loeys-Dietz syndrome features have similarly 
affected first-degree relatives.1,2 TAD in these

AND GUIDELINESpatients have a higher risk of acute aortic dissection or 
rupture, resulting in a shorter life expectancy than those 
patients whose aneurysms are not genetically medi-
ated. Prophylactic surgery to replace the aortic root and 
ascending aorta has dramatically improved the overall 
life expectancy of HTAD patients. Prophylactic elec-
tive surgery in these young patients requires a very low 
operative mortality with a multidisciplinary approach for 
genetic testing and lifelong surveillance. Surgeons in 
Multidisciplinary Aortic Teams have shown sufficiently 
low operative mortality to safely treat these patients at 
smaller aortic sizes. Similar to what is seen with sporadic 
aneurysms, aortic dissection in HTAD can occur at aortic 
diameters smaller than the surgical thresholds recom-
mended in guidelines. nsHTAD refers to a genetic predisposition to TAD 
running in families in the absence of systemic features. NsHTAD may be present in up to 20% of patients with 
TAD (based on family history), is typically inherited in an 
autosomal dominant manner, with a pathogenic genetic 
variant identified in up to 20%. When no pathogenic 
variant is identified in families with nsHTAD, it has often 
been referred to as “familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and 
dissection.” It tends to be more penetrant and of earlier 
onset in men than women within affected families. The 
diagnosis is often delayed until midlife but occurs earlier 
than for sporadic aneurysms; aneurysm growth is also 
typically faster than for sporadic aneurysms."

indexed to height (or body size) increases. When 
the maximal cross-sectional area in square (cm2) 
of the aortic root or ascending aorta divided by the 
patient’s height (m) is ≥ 10 cm2/m, prophylactic 
aortic root replacement is reasonable; when this

outcomes. Aortic root replacement is associated with a very 
low surgical risk3,4,11 when performed by experi-
enced surgeons in Multidisciplinary Aortic Teams. The 2 aortic root replacement procedures per-
formed most commonly in the United States are 
a composite valved graft conduit and a VSRR.13 
The composite valved graft conduit consists of a 
prosthetic aortic valve (typically mechanical but 
may be bioprosthetic) and aortic graft, with reim-
plantation of the coronary arteries (often referred 
to as the modified Bentall procedure). The VSRR 
uses the David procedure, in which the native 
aortic valve is reimplanted into a prosthetic aortic 
graft that is attached to the left ventricular outflow 
tract proximally and to the ascending aorta distally. The advantage of the VSRR is that, if successful, 
patients can potentially avoid the lifelong risks and 
complications associated with prosthetic valves. Consequently, early prophylactic surgery can be 
considered when both the procedural and late risks 
are low."

Marfan syndrome most commonly leads to aneurysms 
of the aortic root and ascending aorta but may also 
affect the distal aorta and its branches.1-4 Unfortunately, 
there are no large datasets to inform the risk of aortic dissection or rupture in patients with Marfan syndrome 
with primary (nondissected) aneurysms of the aortic arch, 
descending, or abdominal aorta, so using a 5.0-cm diam-
eter threshold for surgery, as is used for the aortic root, 
is reasonable. Although uncommon, aortic segments distal to 
the aortic root and ascending aorta may dilate in 
Marfan syndrome, and this occurs more often after 
elective aortic root replacement or after a previ-
ous aortic dissection involving these segments.5 
In patients at acceptable risk for operative repair 
or with a long life expectancy, operative interven-
tion to resect primary (nondissected) aneurysms 
involving the arch, descending, or abdominal aorta 
is reasonable at an aortic diameter threshold of 
≥5.0 cm, depending on the patient’s age, rate of

surgery to replace the dilated aortic root and ascending 
aorta in Loeys-Dietz syndrome depends on multiple fac-
tors and is informed by the specific pathogenic variant, 
phenotypic features, patient age, aortic growth rates, and 
family history (Table 11).1,2,10-12,17
There is little information about size thresholds for 
prophylactic surgery in Loeys-Dietz syndrome to lessen 
the risk of aortic dissection or rupture when there are 
intact aneurysms involving the aortic arch, descending, or 
abdominal aorta, or involving aortic branch vessels.11,12,18 
After aortic dissection, progressive aneurysmal dilation 
commonly occurs and often requires multiple operative 
interventions.11,12,18

Recommendations for Surveillance of Aorta, Medical 
Therapy, and Aortic Surgical Intervention
Pathogenic variants in ACTA2, PRKG1, MYH11, MYLK, 
and LOX confer a highly penetrant risk for TAD that is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.1-4 In these 
nsHTADs, baseline imaging of the thoracic aorta with 
TTE, or with CT or MRI if the ascending aorta is not ade-
quately visualized by TTE, is recommended; surveillance 
imaging is then performed annually, if stable. The arch 
and descending aorta may dilate, in which case surveil-
lance imaging of these segments is also performed. Less 
frequent imaging may be considered when the aorta is 
normal, depending on gene variant, age, and family his-
tory. Beta-blocker therapy is used to lessen hemody-
namic stress on the aorta."

TTE to evaluate for aortic valve function, aortic dila-
tion, and aortic coarctation.1-4 Conversely, in other 
patients undergoing TTE, a finding of unexplained 
aortic root, ascending aortic dilation, or both should 
prompt suspicion of an underlying BAV15; if TTE 
of the aortic valve is inconclusive for BAV, cardiac 
magnetic resonance, cardiac CTA, and TEE can be 
used to better visualize the aortic valve and thereby 
diagnose BAV. Cardiac-gated CT or MRI provides superior images 
of the aortic root and ascending aorta when TTE is 
inadequate to visualize the full extent of the proxi-
mal aorta. The choice between CT or MRI depends 
on patient characteristics, institutional expertise, 
renal function, affordability, and radiation exposure 
concerns.16
3. Certain types of HTAD have an increased preva-
lence of BAV. For example, BAV is present in ∼10% 
of patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome (attribut-
able to pathogenic variants in TGFBR1, TGFBR2, 
SMAD3, TGFB2, and TGFB3),6 and HTAD attrib-
utable to pathogenic variants in NOTCH1, ACTA2, 
MAT2A, SMAD6, and LOX also have an increased 
prevalence of BAV.5,6 Importantly, most patients with 
BAV and TAAs who undergo genetic testing will 
not be found to have a pathologic genetic variant, 
even when their condition is familial."

familial BAV and aortopathy are consistent with an 
autosomal dominant pattern with incomplete pen-
etrance.8-10 In families with BAV and aortic root and 
ascending aortic dilation, obligate carriers may have 
BAV, aortic dilation, both, or neither.7 In families with 
BAV and aortic root and ascending aortic dilation, 
screening of the first-degree relatives (parents, sib-
lings, and children) with TTE to evaluate for BAV and 
aortic dilation identifies affected members. If a family 
member is discovered to have a BAV, aortic dilation,

Synopsis
Although AAA share risk factors with typical athero-
sclerosis, AAA are histopathologically distinct and char-
acterized by medial degeneration of the aortic wall.7 
Most AAA develop an intraluminal thrombus that con-
tributes to ongoing wall degradation via oxidative stress, 
smooth muscle cell apoptosis, proteolysis of the extra-
cellular matrix, and adventitial inflammation.8 A complex 
interplay of hereditary and environmental risk factors 
contributes to AAA, most notably older age, male sex, 
smoking, and a positive family history (Table 15).2,3,9-12 Lifetime risk for AAA is 8.2% in men and 10.5% in cur-
rent smokers.11 At least 10% to 25% of patients with 
AAA have a family member with the same condition,2 
and AAA may occur concomitantly with thoracic aortic 
aneurysmal disease, especially in some genetic aortop-
athies.11 Inflammatory aortitis is a rare cause of AAA13,14

Synopsis
The goal of BP control in TAA is to slow growth and 
prevent aortic dissection, as well as to reduce nonaor-
tic cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction 
and stroke. Uncontrolled hypertension increases the risk 
for aortic dissection,7 so achieving a SBP goal of ≤130 
mm Hg and a DBP goal of ≤80 mm Hg, with the use of 
antihypertensive therapy in those with hypertension and 
TAA, is advised. Although data are limited, achieving a 
more intensive SBP goal of <120 mm Hg, if tolerated, 
may have added benefit in selected patients and who 
are not undergoing surgical repair.4 There has been sig-
nificant progress in understanding the molecular basis of 
aneurysmal development and growth,8 and a number of 
clinical trials have explored the effects of beta-blocker 
and ARB therapy.9 A summary of these trials specific

optimal threshold to which BP should be lowered 
in patients with TAA to reduce the risk of aortic 
complications (aortic growth, aortic dissection,

Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized 
in the Online Data Supplement. In patients with AAA and an average SBP of 
≥130 mm Hg, or an average DBP of ≥80 mm 
Hg, the use of antihypertensive medication is 
recommended to reduce risk of cardiovascular 
events.1-3
Synopsis
Reducing cardiovascular events such as myocardial 
infarction and stroke, as well as preventing aneurysm 
growth and rupture, are the main goals in antihyper-
tensive therapy in AAA. Uncontrolled hypertension is a 
known risk factor for aortic rupture and dissection; there-
fore, achieving an SBP goal of <130 mm Hg, and a DBP 
goal of <80 mm Hg with the use of antihypertensive 
therapy in those with hypertension and AAA can reduce 
adverse clinical outcomes, and some patients may ben-
efit from more intensive lowering with an SBP goal of 
<120 mm Hg.4 The most robust evidence of antihyper-
tensive therapy in AAA is for beta blockers and agents 
that alter the renin angiotensin system; however, in pro-
spective clinical trials in humans, no specific agent has 
been proven to inhibit AAA growth. Updated hypertension guidelines from the ACC 
and AHA suggest all patients with clinical cardio-
vascular disease have a target SBP of <130 mm 
Hg and/or DBP <80 mm Hg.1 Evidence supports 
aggressive BP lowering to reduce vascular-related

BP control to SBP <120 mm Hg reduced cardio-

In patients with AAA, imaging assessment of the abdom-
inal aorta is important for establishing baseline diameter 
and determining the timing of surveillance imaging. Ultra-
sound imaging has been the standard for surveillance 
imaging of the abdominal aorta and is widely used. CT 
provides superior visualization of the abdominal aorta 
and its branches and is therefore used for preopera-
tive planning. MRI is a reasonable alternative to CT in 
selected patients. Figure 20 shows a proposed general 
algorithm for surveillance imaging of AAA, recognizing

algorithm for surveillance imaging of AAA, recognizing 
that surveillance intervals should be individualized. Multiple studies have established that ultrasound 
surveillance of AAAs helps to prevent rupture and 
mortality.2-7 ,11 The risk of rupture increases at an 
AAA diameter of >5.5 cm for men and >5.0 cm for 
women; accordingly, surveillance imaging should 
be more frequent at larger AAA diameters that 
approach these thresholds. Conversely, at AAA 
diameters of 3.0 cm to 3.9 cm, longer surveillance 
imaging intervals have been shown to be safe. In patients with AAA of 4.0 cm to 4.9 cm, rates 
of aortic growth are higher, so annual surveillance 
ultrasound is recommended. Even shorter intervals 
are often used in those who smoke, have diabetes, 
or both because of their increased risk of growth. Once the size of the AAA reaches ≥ 5.0 cm in men 
and ≥4.5 cm in women, the screening interval is 
shortened to every 6 months given the potential of

Aortic Aneurysms
Most patients with TAA and AAA are asymptomatic, so 
the purpose of surgical or endovascular intervention is 
to reduce the risk of adverse aortic events (ie, aortic dis-
section, rupture, and aortic-related death). Consequently, 
determining the optimal timing of intervention requires a 
careful anatomic assessment, followed by weighing the 
risk of future adverse aortic events against the risk of 
intervention.The goal of open surgery is to replace the 
aneurysmal aortic segment with a prosthetic graft anas-
tomosed to nonaneurysmal aortic tissues while maintain-
ing critical aortic branch vessels. Endovascular repair 
leverages contiguous nonaneurysmal aortic or iliac seg-
ments for fixation of endovascular stent grafts to exclude 
blood flow from the aneurysmal sac. To date, the FDA 
has approved individual stent grafts for the treatment of 
aneurysms involving the descending thoracic, juxtarenal, 
and infrarenal aortic segments. Stent graft devices to 
address the ascending aorta, aortic arch, and thoracoab-
dominal aorta are available under investigational use in 
the United States, currently in physician- and industry-
sponsored clinical trials."

decreased wall strength, or a combination of both, is an 
area of active research.25-29 Maximal aortic diameter has 
logically been the primary criterion for elective aneurysm 
repair because, per LaPlace’s law, wall stress increases 
proportionally with aortic radius and inversely to thick-
ness.30 The original natural history studies examined 
the risk of rupture or aortic dissection versus diameter

to patient height ratio of ≥10 cm2/m was found to 
correlate with increased mortality among unoper-

of the cross-sectional aortic area to height ratio is 
most appropriate in patients whose height is >1 
standard deviation above or below the mean. A single-center large database of TAA has grown 
considerably and was reevaluated with indexing 
of aortic diameter to BSA (ASI) or height (AHI), to 
improve the prediction of adverse aortic events.23 
Height was preferred because the variable nature 
of weight and the underlying genetic contribu-

The goal of prophylactic repair of aneurysms of the aortic 
root and ascending aorta is to prevent life-threatening 
complications from acute aortic events such as aortic dis-
section, aortic rupture, or sudden death. This goal is best 
achieved when the risk of future adverse aortic events is 
greater than the expected surgical mortality (considering 
both the surgeon’s and institutional experience). The STS 
database has clearly shown that proximal thoracic aortic 
surgery has a lower operative mortality when performed 
electively rather than emergently (2.2% versus 17 .2%, 
respectively).1

Aortic arch aneurysms are the least common of the TAA,

common cause of arch aneurysms; in a large meta-
analysis, only 28.3% of patients undergoing intervention 
on the arch had de novo aneurysmal disease, with the 
remainder resulting from acute or chronic aortic dissec-
tion. The risk of dissection or rupture, as related to aor-
tic diameter, is presumed to be similar in the arch as in 
other thoracic locations, although no large reports con-
sider arch dimensions alone. Additionally, because of the

Synopsis
Although no RCTs comparing TEVAR with open repair 
of descending TAA exist, the pivotal device trials1,3,10 
have shown a reduced perioperative morbidity, increased 
clinical utility, and reduced follow-up aneurysm-related 
mortality compared with open surgical repair. However, 
reintervention after TEVAR is substantial.11 In addition, 
although clinical device trials showed improved periop-
erative and long-term outcomes with TEVAR, Medicare 
claims data show that the perioperative advantage was 
lost within the first year after intact aneurysm repair, 
with a 5-year survival that was significantly worse after 
TEVAR versus open repair, at 79% versus 89%, respec-
tively (P<0.0001).4 Further study should be dedicated to 
understanding why the benefit from endovascular repair 
decays over time. In patients with connective tissue dis-
orders or HTAD, or those with a longer life expectancy, 
open surgical repair is reasonable. Open surgical repair 
of descending TAA reflects a volume-outcomes relation-
ship: Although large institutional series have shown good 
outcomes with open repair,6-9 these results are not repli-
cable at lower volume centers.12 The decision to proceed 
with endovascular versus open repair balances the need 
for appropriate anatomy and access, as well as a higher 
reintervention rate for TEVAR versus the higher periop-
erative risk associated with more definitive open surgical 
repair.Table 18."

Synopsis
Left subclavian artery coverage is required in up to 40% 
of cases of TEVAR of descending TAAs.4 SCI and stroke 
remain devastating complications associated with TEVAR. Addressing these modifiable risk factors would allow 
for better outcomes after this less invasive treatment 
strategy. In addition, special considerations include the 
prevention of vertebrobasilar insufficiency (particularly 
among those with a dominant left vertebral artery), pres-
ervation of any preexisting left internal mammary artery 
coronary bypass graft, as well as left upper extremity 
dialysis access or other left upper extremity-based graft."
58_0,58,0,"CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINESCurrently, pivotal as well as feasibility trials are ongoing 
for branched endografts intending to preserve flow to 
the left subclavian artery. Longer-term follow-up of this 
technology is needed, but initial results are promising.5,6
Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text
1. Up to 40% of patients undergoing TEVAR for thoracic 
aneurysm repair require left subclavian artery cover-
age. Preoperative left subclavian revascularization 
has been shown to decrease the rates of stroke2,7 ,8 
and SCI.1,2 Vertebrobasilar insufficiency and left arm 
ischemia can also occur without left subclavian artery 
revascularization.9,10 Patients with a patent left inter-
nal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery 
coronary artery bypass graft, or who are otherwise 
reliant on inflow from the left subclavian artery (eg, 
for dialysis access), should undergo left subclavian 
revascularization to preserve flow.9
2. Patients undergoing TEVAR with left subclavian 
coverage may not be hemodynamically stable 
enough to undergo preemptive revascularization of 
the left subclavian artery. If such patients go on to 
develop SCI after TEVAR, there have been case 
reports of SCI reversal with secondary revascular-
ization of the left subclavian artery.3

Synopsis
Celiac artery coverage is estimated to be necessary 
in 15% of patients undergoing TEVAR for descend-
ing TAA repair.2 The safety and use of this practice has 
previously been shown with single-institution series cit-
ing low incidence of postoperative visceral ischemia. However, despite the preoperative evaluation with CTA, 
angiography, or both to confirm adequate collateraliza-
tion between the celiac and superior mesenteric artery 
(SMA), a small percentage of patients still die from vis-
ceral ischemia. In addition, late distal migration of the 
endograft can encroach on the SMA, creating SMA 
stenosis and compromising flow through the SMA and 
celiac-based collaterals. Migration of the endograft distally over time can 
cause stenosis of the SMA and decrease flow to the SMA and celiac artery-based collaterals. In 
patients undergoing TEVAR with celiac artery cov-
erage who have adequate collateralization on CTA, 
angiography, or both, a small percentage of patients 
go on to develop postoperative visceral ischemia."

to death. Ruptured Descending TAARecommendations for Ruptured Descending TAA

associated with decreased perioperative morbid-
ity and mortality compared with open repair. In 1 
retrospective multi-institution study, TEVAR had a 
lower composite rate of death, stroke, and perma-
nent paraplegia compared with open surgery and 
a trend toward lower aneurysm-related mortality 
at 4 years.1 Similarly, a meta-analysis showed that 
TEVAR was associated with a lower perioperative 
mortality and myocardial infarction rate compared 
with open repair.1 A multicenter, prospective clinical 
trial for aortic catastrophes—including aortic rup-
ture—showed that TEVAR was superior with regard 
to the composite endpoint of mortality and para-
plegia, compared with open repair.5 Although the"

AND GUIDELINESperioperative benefit of endovascular repair of rup-
tured TAA was again corroborated in a Medicare-

disappeared after 1.5 years.4
2. When ruptured descending TAA present, coverage 
of the left subclavian artery, celiac artery, or both 
may be necessary to gain the necessary 2 cm of 
seal zone for successful endovascular repair. Left 
subclavian artery and celiac artery coverage during 
thoracic aortic rupture has been associated with 
reasonable technical success and outcomes in sin-
gle-institution series6 and 1 clinical trial5 in patients 
with acute rupture or complicated dissection of the 
descending thoracic aorta. Access Issues for TEVAR in Descending TAARecommendations for Access Issues for TEVAR in Descending TAA

Synopsis
Iliac artery access for stent-graft delivery systems is 
marginal in up to 21% of cases in which TEVAR is per-
formed for descending TAA.1 Careful review of the CTA 
of the iliofemoral system is required to ensure that mar-
ginal or inadequate access is noted and properly man-
aged. Marginal access can be successfully circumvented 
using surgical bypass, direct aortic or iliac exposure, or 
endovascular techniques to treat vessel stenosis. Percu-
taneous access was used successfully for endovascular 
abdominal aortic repair before it was applied to larger 
sheath devices. This technology has also been applied 
to TEVAR with a similarly high degree of success and 
reduced hospital length of stay. Thoracic endovascular stent grafts are housed in 
large delivery systems, thus thorough review of

events and death. Intervention at diameters of <6.0 cm 
would reduce aortic-related events and death. There 
are also conditions in which intervention may be justi-

penetrating ulcers, mycotic aneurysms, connective tissue 
disorders). Concerns for operative death in the setting 
of comorbid conditions is certainly justified. However, in 
centers with a Multidisciplinary Aortic Team, excellent 
outcomes can be obtained despite the presence of such 
conditions, and fatal aortic events may thus be avoided. Aortic event rates begin to rise significantly, and 
5-year survival begins to fall when TAAA diame-

There are no RCTs comparing early or late outcomes 
for open versus endovascular repair for TAAA. As of 
November 2022, there are no FDA-approved devices for 
endovascular TAAA repair. Most of the endovascular pro-
cedures currently performed are done so with customized 
fenestrated or branched endografts on investigational 
device exemption- or industry-sponsored trials. Although 
the number of endovascular repairs performed has been 
steadily increasing, follow-up remains limited, and open 
repair therefore remains the preferred therapy for patients 
with TAAA who require intervention. The results for open 
repair are excellent in centers with a Multidisciplinary Aor-
tic Team. In the largest series published to date, the oper-
ative mortality rate in 3 309 patients undergoing open

had not shown a benefit for cerebrospinal fluid drainage 
in TAAA repair. A more recent RCT did show a significant 
reduction in SCI for a cohort undergoing repair of exten-
sive TAAA (extent I and extent II) when cerebrospinal 
fluid drainage was used. Delayed SCI may occur up to 2 weeks after surgery. This complication has a profound impact on short- and 
long-term outcomes.10,12 Early recognition and aggres-
sive management of SCI can lead to a return of lower 
extremity function. The reinsertion of a cerebrospinal 
fluid drain is a key component to salvage lower extrem-
ity function. Additional therapies, such as volume loading, 
increasing mean arterial pressure, and maximizing oxy-
gen delivery to the cord through transfusion or supple-
mental oxygen, are also critical. TAAA repair remains a formidable undertak-
ing regardless of whether open or endovascular 
repair is performed. SCI, with either paraparesis or 
paraplegia, may be temporary or permanent and 
has a profoundly negative impact on short- and 
long-term survival as well as quality of life after 
repair. Many techniques have been suggested to 
reduce the incidence of this significant complica-

Synopsis
Postoperative renal dysfunction after open TAAA repair 
has a significantly negative impact on short- and long-
term mortality as well as quality of life. Efforts to reduce 
renal injury during open TAAA repair include local organ 
hypothermia with either cold crystalloid or cold blood-
based perfusate. Renal dysfunction after TAAA repair is defined as 
a doubling of the creatinine or the need for hemo-
dialysis. When this significant complication occurs, 
short- and long-term survival is compromised, and 
the incidence of postoperative respiratory failure, 
SCI, and cardiac complications increase. To iden-
tify methods to reduce the incidence of postop-
erative renal dysfunction, 2 RCTs were performed"
63_0,63,0,"When compared with normother-
mic blood delivered into the renal arteries directly 
from the left heart bypass circuit, the delivery of cold

Subsequently, cold blood perfusate delivered to 
the renal arteries through occlusion or perfusion 
catheters was found to provide the same level of 
renal protection as cold crystalloid perfusate during 
open TAAA repair.5 The results of this second RCT 
provided surgeons with 2 options for renal protec-

reconstruction. In patients with renal or visceral artery stenoses 
or ostial obstruction secondary to chronic or acute 
dissection flaps, end-organ perfusion may be com-

Synopsis
The mortality rate from ruptured abdominal aortic aneu-
rysms (rAAA) is estimated to be 80% to 90%, with most 
patients never reaching the hospital.13 For those who 
present to a hospital, the historical mortality rate for open 
repair was approximately 50%."

AND GUIDELINESorganization, prompt diagnosis, and endovascular repair 
options, the mortality rate after repair for rAAA has been 
reported to be as low as 18.5% after instituting an endo-
vascular repair-first strategy in at least 1 observational 
series.1 Initial randomized trials for endovascular repair 
for rAAA (rEVAR) versus open repair generally showed 
no early survival benefit. However, shortcomings of these 
trials raised questions about their applicability.2,14,15 Lon-
ger-term studies of rEVAR, such as 3-year results from 
the IMPROVE (Immediate Management of the Patient 
With Rupture: Open Versus Endovascular Repair) trial, 
showed late survival benefit from rEVAR over open repair. Many authors have evaluated institutional experience 
with using rEVAR in anatomically suitable candidates 
and aimed to improve the process of care for rAAA by 
adopting “rupture protocols” that include early imaging, 
permissive hypotension, endovascular balloon occlusion 
under fluoroscopy to reduce excessive bleeding, and a 
team-based organization to facilitate immediate transfer 
of patients to the operating room for prompt hemorrhage 
control and repair.1,3

status. In contemporary practice, many patients 
will have a CT scan, although some of these scans 
will not be ideally timed arterial phase imaging. Given that time is of the essence in rAAA repair, 
if a patient’s CT scan provides enough anatomic

is feasible, another more dedicated CTA scan may 
add unnecessary delays to the patient’s care."

Synopsis
One of the most significant risk factors for continued 
aneurysm growth and rupture is the maximum diameter. Thresholds for AAA repair must balance the expected 
risk of rupture against the risk of operative interven-
tion. Historically, the risk of rupture was reported to be 
0.5% to 5% for aneurysms <5 cm in maximum diameter, 
3% to 15% for aneurysms 5 cm to 6.9 cm, and ≥30% 
for aneurysms ≥8 cm.10 Multiple trials that are now >2 
decades old evaluated the use of early repair of AAAs 
measuring 4.0 cm to 5.4 cm via open or endovascular 
means. All found no survival benefit attributable to early 
repair and but did find an increased risk of subsequent 
reintervention. These studies and others have found that 
rupture does occur at smaller diameters for women; thus, 
size thresholds for men and women differ to account 
for these observed differences.6,11 Newer data highlight

AND GUIDELINESSurgery recommended elective repair of patients 
presenting with saccular AAA, although size guid-
ance is lacking because of limited natural history 
data. Clearly, the decision to intervene must be 
informed by the patient’s individual anatomy. Pooled analysis from thousands of patients 
included in AAA surveillance studies from North 
America, Western Europe, and East Asia showed 
that, although aneurysm growth is highly variable, 
growth rates range from 1.5 mm/y to 2 mm/y for 
those with AAA of 3.0 cm to 3.9 cm and from 3.3 
mm/y to 5.7 mm/y in AAA of 4.0 cm to 5.9 cm 
at baseline.17 ,18 The 4 major trials evaluating effi-
cacy of early open and endovascular treatment of 
AAA for small aneurysms all excluded patients with 
aneurysms that grew ≥7 mm in 6 months or >10 
mm in 12 months, given concern for increased risk 
of rupture. Thus, balancing the risks, aneurysms 
with size increases of ≥0.5 cm in 6 months or ≥1 
cm in 1 year are considered to be rapidly growing 
and may warrant consideration of repair. Open Versus Endovascular Repair of AAARecommendations for Open Versus Endovascular Repair of AAA

in the Vascular Quality Initiatives registry (4.7% ver-
sus 3.3%, respectively, P =0.17).17 Evaluating data 
from the ACS, Varkevisser et al found much higher 
odds of 30-day death from open repair compared 
with FEVAR (OR, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.4–19).10 The risk 
of immediate postoperative complications, such as 
myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury, and the 
initiation of dialysis, is significantly higher after 
open complex repair compared with FEVAR.11,17 ,18 However, rates of late reintervention are higher 
after FEVAR,11,18 as are the rates of persistent renal 
impairment11 and 3-year mortality rate (excluding 
perioperative deaths) (hazard ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 
1.1–2.6).17 Thus, similar to infrarenal repair, FEVAR 
may be most beneficial for the moderate- to high-
risk surgical candidates who are more likely to 
experience perioperative complications. Treatment of Concomitant Common Iliac

nostic imaging techniques.6 In certain clinical cir-
cumstances, for example, patients with a history 
of an iodinated contrast reaction or patients who 
are too unstable to travel to the radiology suite, CT 
may not be preferred. Echocardiography (TEE/
TTE) is an alternative. TTE is noninvasive, can be 
performed at the bedside, and may be helpful in 
eliciting the diagnosis of AAS and quickly identify-
ing complications of AAS, such as AR or pericardial 
effusion and tamponade. TEE is preferred to TTE, 
however, because of its higher sensitivity and bet-
ter anatomic resolution; TEE can be performed at 
the bedside in the emergency department or, alter-
natively, once the patient is in the operating room. MRI is most commonly the third-choice modality, 
given that it is not readily available, requires skilled 
interpretation, and has longer acquisition times, as 
well as the fact it is challenging to provide clini-
cal care to potentially unstable patients while in 
an MRI scanner. Consequently, MRI is most often 
used as a follow-up imaging modality in patients in 
which there is diagnostic uncertainty. Nevertheless, 
MRI may be the study of choice in the acute set-

1. There are no randomized studies that have evalu-
ated different medical treatments in the treatment 
of AAS, although extensive clinical experience has 
established the current standard of anti-impulse 
therapy. This is usually accomplished with a com-
bination of intravenous beta blockers (eg, esmo-
lol, metoprolol, and labetalol) and vasodilators (eg, 
nicardipine, clevidipine, and sodium nitroprusside) 
with the goal of reducing both heart rate and BP to 
decrease aortic wall stress.2-5,7 ,8,11
2. Small, single-center studies have highlighted the 
importance of reducing heart rate to 60 to 80 bpm 
and SBP to <120 mm Hg. Experts believe that the

function should be targeted.3,11

4. Intravenous vasodilators are useful adjunctive 
therapy for intravenous beta blockers but should 
be avoided as initial treatment (before starting beta 
blockers or calcium channel blockers), given the 
potential for compensatory tachycardia.8,9

renal effects. Subsequent Medical Management of AASRecommendation for Subsequent Medical Management of AAS
Referenced studies that support the recommendation are summarized

To reduce the risk of late aortic complications, surgical 
resection should include the tear site, any aneurysmal 
aorta, and the proximal-most extent of the dissection. A nonresected primary tear is a risk factor for reop-
eration.32 A more extensive replacement that involves 
the aortic root, arch, or both adds operative complexity, 
ischemic time, and potentially circulatory arrest time but 
may reduce the risk of future aortic dilation, aortic insuf-
ficiency, or repeat dissection. An individualized approach 
to aortic root management is based on pathology and 
general condition. Younger patients are more likely to 
have proximal extension or root involvement and may 
have greater potential for late complications, given their 
longer life expectancy."

Similarly, untreated aortic arch or descending thoracic 
aortic tissue may be at risk of aneurysmal enlargement 
and the need for reintervention, particularly with acute 
type A aortic dissection that extends into the descending 
thoracic aorta. An open distal anastomosis allows direct 
arch inspection for intimal tears and resection of the 
lesser curve of the arch (ie, hemiarch technique) with-
out increased operative death.12,13,34 In-hospital death is 
lower with hemiarch repair than with total arch replace-

are scarce. Involvement of the aortic arch by the aortic dissection 
can influence both interventional strategies and clinical 
outcomes."

8.1% with aortic valve resuspension as the pre-

with 23.1% with root replacement.43 Studies on 
freedom from reoperation are mixed,1,7 ,41,44-46 but

reoperation rates 1.4% to 2.1% per patient-year

however, even in multivariable logistic regression, 
it was associated with a higher risk of stroke (OR,

Synopsis
Aortic IMH is a distinct pathologic entity from aortic 
dissection and PAU. It is characterized by hemorrhage 
within the media of the aortic wall and may occur with or 
without intimal disruption. Radiographically, IMH appears 
as a high-attenuation crescentic or circumferential thick-
ening of the aorta on noncontrast imaging, with absence 
of blood flow through a false lumen on contrast imaging."

Aortic IMH is a distinct pathologic entity from aortic

within the media of the aortic wall and may occur with or 
without intimal disruption. Radiographically, IMH appears 
as a high-attenuation crescentic or circumferential thick-
ening of the aorta on noncontrast imaging, with absence 
of blood flow through a false lumen on contrast imaging. IMH occurs more commonly in the descending thoracic 
aorta (60%) than in the ascending aorta (30%) or aortic 
arch (10%).1 Classification is the same as is used for 
acute aortic dissection. Symptoms at presentation are 
similar to aortic dissection, but patients tend to be older 
and more often have hypertension and atherosclero-
sis.1,2 Malperfusion can occur but less frequently than in 
aortic dissection.1,2 IMH can progress to aortic enlarge-
ment, aortic dissection, or aortic rupture; alternatively, 
the hematoma can sometimes be resorbed.3 Of patients 
presenting with AAS, the proportion who have IMH var-
ies based by region, with reports of 6% to 23% in North 
America and Europe1,6 versus 26% to 44% in Asia.4,5,12Table 29. Features of Complicated IM HFeatur e

comorbidities, the differing lethality of type A and type B 
IMH, mortality and death associated with open or endo-
vascular repair in the different segments of the aorta,

management. Prospective randomized comparative stud-
ies are lacking, and most series and registries are limited

Synopsis
A PAU is an atherosclerotic lesion of the aorta with 
ulceration that penetrates the internal elastic lamina and 
allows hematoma formation within the media of the aor-
tic wall.5 PAUs may progress to AAS with IMH formation, 
aortic dissection, or rupture.1,2,6 PAU with IMH is asso-
ciated with a high risk of short-term disease progres-
sion,1 particularly when localized to the ascending aorta 
(ie, Stanford type A).1,2 Data on outcomes for PAU with 
descending thoracic and abdominal aorta (ie, Stanford 
type B) IMH are limited to small retrospective reviews 
but suggest significant early disease progression among 
patients treated with medical management.1,2 PAUs tend 
to affect elderly patients with severe atherosclerotic dis-
ease and other comorbidities that put them at high sur-
gical risk even with endovascular interventions, so the 
risk of repair must be weighed against the risk of severe 
morbidity and patient life expectancy when making deci-
sions about appropriate management."

tion is associated with a high mortality rate (of 5 of

Isolated PAUs are those without associated IMH, aortic 
dissection, or saccular aneurysm. Symptomatic isolated 
PAUs may herald a developing peri-ulcer hematoma, IMH, or both and are more likely to progress or result 
in rupture than asymptomatic PAUs.5 For patients who 
present with a symptomatic PAU but whose symptoms 
resolve with goal-directed therapy or patients who are 
poor operative candidates at increased risk for morbidity 
and death from repair, medical management has been 
pursued, with early and frequent surveillance imaging to 
assess for disease progression.4
Asymptomatic isolated PAUs are increasingly diag-
nosed incidentally because of the increasing use of CTA."

BTTAI, although rare, is the second-most common cause 
of death in trauma patients; it results from high decelera-
tion forces and is often associated with concomitant inju-
ries. In the ACS National Trauma Databank, the diagnosis 
of BTTAI increased 196.8% from 2003 to 2013, likely 
attributable to more sensitive imaging.3 The mortality rate 
of patients with BTTAI who were treated in the emer-
gency department was ∼19%.4,5 Initial management of 
polytrauma at trauma centers follows Advanced Trauma 
Life Support protocols. However, for patients with BTTAI, 
special attention to BP and heart rate is warranted 
because of their effects on injury extension and rupture. In stable patients, the 2011 Society for Vascular 
Surgery clinical practice guidelines6 suggested urgent 
(<24 h) repair barring other serious concomitant non-
aortic injuries or immediately after treatment of other 
injuries. In a recent study from the National Trauma Data 
Bank, early (<24 h) repair had increased odds of death 
(adjusted OR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.01–5.67; P=0.047).7 A 
multicenter study showed worse adjusted mortality rate 
with early repair overall (adjusted OR, 7 .78; 95% CI,

favoring delayed repair (P>0.05).8

Synopsis
The most common site of BTTAI is the aortic isthmus, 
because of its site as transition from the unfixed aor-
tic arch to the fixed descending thoracic aorta and the 
relatively lesser tensile strength of this region. Aortic injuries are classified according to severity, based on the findings of diagnostic imaging. Adapted from Azizzadeh et al,2 Copyright 2009, with permission from Elsevier, Inc. and the Society for Vascular Surgery."

AND GUIDELINESsegments that may be involved include the proximal 
ascending aorta (8%–27%), aortic arch (8%–18%), and 
distal descending thoracic aorta (11%–21%). The most 
widely used grading scale is that proposed by Estrera 
et al and endorsed by the SVS clinical practice guide-
line (Figure 23).1,2 In Estrera’s original paper, all patients 
with grade 1 injuries were managed medically and had a 
0% mortality rate.2 Current SVS guidelines recommend 
expectant management of grade 1 injuries and repair of 
all other grades.1 Trauma studies have found that 32% 
of BTTAIs are managed nonoperatively,3 with an associ-
ated mortality rate of 25%.5 Overall mortality rate was 
significantly higher in nonoperatively managed patients 
(35.0% versus 11.2%; P<0.001), while aortic-related 
mortality rate was similar (9.8% versus 5.0%; P=0.119).3

Management
1. The decision for nonoperative versus opera-
tive management of BTTAI includes complex and 
dynamic factors such as the patient’s stability, 
concomitant injuries, and potential imaging char-
acteristics that may predict aortic stability. Grade 1 
BTTAIs are likely to resolve and are associated with 
extremely low aortic-related death. Medical man-
agement and follow-up imaging to ensure resolu-
tion is appropriate.1,2
2. Grade 3 and 4 BTTAIs are at high risk of pro-
gression and rupture and should be treated in an 
urgent manner. In grade 3 injuries, nonoperative 
management was an independent predictor of all-
cause death (OR, 29.65; 95% CI, 5.62–15.649; 
P<0.0001), and imaging characteristics did not 
predict aortic-related death.4

center reported no differences in mortality rates or 
aortic-related mortality rates between nonopera-
tive and operative management of grade 1 and 2

secondary signs are more common in patients with

ger consideration for operative intervention.6 The

BAAI represents a rare traumatic entity, occurring in <1% 
of patients with blunt trauma. Patients with BAAI often 
have concomitant injuries such as rib fractures, abdomi-
nal visceral injury, and cardiac complications that will 
affect treatment decisions. Similar to BTTAI, abdominal 
aortic injuries are graded based on aortic contour defects, 
and this grading can be used to provide a framework 
for treatment and determination of risk of major morbid-
ity and death from injuries (Table 33). Because BAAI is 
rare and symptoms are wide ranging, patients should 
be managed on an individual basis. In general, patients 
with grade 1 aortic injuries can likely be managed with 
antihypertensive therapy, beta blockade, and antiplatelet 
therapy, if not contraindicated, with repeat scan at 24 to 
48 hours. Grade 2 injuries can similarly be managed non-
operatively but may progress to include end-organ ves-
sel thrombosis or rupture. Grade 3 injuries may benefit 
from endovascular treatments if anatomically amenable. Grade 4 injuries are more likely to present with refractory 
hypotension, warranting rapid control of hemorrhage, 
which may be done in the emergency department (eg, 
antero-lateral thoracotomy with aortic cross-clamping) or 
operating room."

are used for BAAI repair will depend on patient’s clinical status, hospital resources, and practitioner experience. Additionally, Shalhub et al1 propose using aortic injury 
zone categorization when considering options for repair, 
which differ from traumatic abdominal zones of injury 
(Figure 24). Specifically, in their multicenter experience, 
some zone 2 and 3 injuries could be managed endovas-
cularly while no zone 2 injuries were managed this way. Lastly, data on the use of REBOA for hemorrhage below 
the diaphragm, not performed in the operating theater, 
and without fluoroscopic guidance are mixed, with few 
data showing survival benefit and some trauma registry 
data showing harm. Because BAAI is very rare, in an effort to provide 
clinical evidence for the management of BAAI, 
Shalhub et al1 aggregated data from 12 trauma 
centers. In the authors’ experience in treating 113 
patients with BAAI, most of those with grade 1 
and 2 injuries were successfully managed non-
operatively with anti-impulse therapy and repeat 
CTA imaging. Most of these injuries did not show

BAAI were within the first 24 hours of presenta-

evidence of malperfusion and thus be managed 
nonoperatively. However, for patients who pres-
ent with or progress to organ or limb malperfu-
sion, endovascular or open repair may be needed 
to reduce morbidity and mortality rates. In their 
multicenter experience, Shalhub et al1 found that 
of the 38 patients who present with grade 2 inju-
ries, 45% were initially managed nonoperatively, 
34% were treated with open repair, and 21% were 
treated with endovascular repair. Of those initially 
managed conservatively, 3 eventually progressed 
to having ischemic symptoms warranting consid-
eration of repair, with 1 patient who refused repair 
who died of sepsis from limb ischemia, another who 
died intraoperatively, and a third who successfully 
underwent hybrid endovascular and open repair. Both endovascular and open approaches have 
been described for BAAI,1-4 and analyses of large 
trauma databases reveal no significant differences 
in mortality rates between the two. Anatomical 
considerations, patient clinical status and comorbid 
injuries, and practitioner experience will influence 
the choice of approach. Shalhub et al1 found that 
aortic zone 2 and 3 injuries appeared to be more 
amenable to endovascular approaches, while most grade 4 injuries were treated with open surgery.1,2

segments because of underlying medial degenera-
tion. Consequently, repeat intervention on the aortic 
root, arch, or thoracoabdominal aorta may become

nation at the time of implantation; graft enteric erosion or 
fistula to adjacent bowel, esophagus, or airway; or, rarely, 
hematogenous spread from remote infection. Suspicion 
is usually raised by symptoms, laboratory test abnormali-
ties, or axial imaging findings. In the presence of an aor-
tic graft infection, no surgical option is clearly superior. Basic tenets are to remove all infected tissue, includ-

was 9.1 (95% CI, 3.3–25.2; P <0.001).7 Moreover, 
in a clinical trial of 519 patients with severe tho-
racic aortic plaques, multivariate analysis showed 
that statin therapy was protective against strokes 
(P=0.0001).8 (The data from these 2 studies 
relate specifically to atheroma thickness of ≥ 4

the use of prophylactic anticoagulation in this

Aortic mural thrombus is typically associated with under-
lying aortic pathology, such as aneurysm, aortitis, athero-
sclerosis, dissection, and aortic graft material.1-3 Because 
such thrombi arise in the setting of underlying aortic 
pathology, the thrombi can be considered “secondary,”

“Porcelain” aorta refers to the extensive, eggshell-like, 
near-circumferential or circumferential calcification of 
the intima or media of the aortic wall in the ascend-
ing aorta or aortic arch. It is most often associated with 
late-stage atherosclerosis, although it can also be a 
late consequence of aortitis. It generally occurs in older 
patients with atherosclerotic disease elsewhere and 
carries an increased risk for cardiovascular events and 
mortality.1 Porcelain aorta is best seen on a noncontrast 
CT scan, although very thin calcification may only be 
detected intraoperatively with epi-aortic ultrasound or 
manual palpation.Impenetrable ascending aortic calci-
fication makes it difficult, if not impossible, to perform 
central aortic cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass, 
the anastomosis of proximal coronary bypass grafts to 
the aorta, aortotomy during aortic valve replacement, 
and graft-aorta anastomoses during aortic replace-
ment. Additionally, performing aortic cross-clamping for 
cardiopulmonary bypass can crack the calcified wall, 
increasing the risk of stroke from embolization, or imme-
diate exsanguination."

Synopsis
CoA may have many anatomic variants and occurs most 
commonly at the level of the ductus arteriosus and dis-
tal to the left subclavian artery. Echocardiogram is indi-
cated in the evaluation of patients with CoA because a 
BAV coexists in at least 50% of cases, and CoA may 
associate with complex congenital heart disease.4 Upper 
extremity hypertension and lower extremity hypoperfu-
sion are the hallmarks of CoA. Intracranial aneurysms 
may occur in adults with CoA.14-16 Ascending aortic

Synopsis
CoA may have many anatomic variants and occurs most 
commonly at the level of the ductus arteriosus and dis-
tal to the left subclavian artery. Echocardiogram is indi-
cated in the evaluation of patients with CoA because a 
BAV coexists in at least 50% of cases, and CoA may 
associate with complex congenital heart disease.4 Upper 
extremity hypertension and lower extremity hypoperfu-
sion are the hallmarks of CoA. Intracranial aneurysms 
may occur in adults with CoA.14-16 Ascending aortic 
aneurysms may occur in those with BAV, and aneu-
rysms may be present in the distal arch and descend-
ing aorta.2,11,19,20 Untreated CoA may be complicated 
by aortic dissection, heart failure, ruptured cerebral 
aneurysm, or complications from hypertension. Repair 
of CoA is performed by endovascular, open surgical, 
and hybrid procedures, depending on patient-specific 
and anatomic features.2,3,5,8-12 In patients with previous 
procedures, late complications may include recurrent 
stenosis, aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm formation, rup-
ture, and persistent hypertension.2,3,6,8,12,21 Hypertension 
is common after CoA repair, especially during exercise, 
and ambulatory monitoring and exercise testing may be 
useful in diagnosis and management.3,6,7 ,22-24 Lifelong 
clinical and imaging follow-up is important to evaluate 
for hypertension, recurrent coarctation, and aortic wall 
abnormalities after repair.1,2,6,24Table 37 ."

detect coexistent BAV, examine the full thoracic 
aorta for coexistent aneurysm disease or arch

TTE is also can detect the gradients across the 
site of the coarctation and assess for recoarctation 
(recurrence of a significant coarct). After repair of 
CoA, complications may occur, including recoarc-
tation, aortic aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm, and aor-
tic dissection.2,3,11,12,26 Arch and descending aortic 
complications are better visualized by MRI or CT 
than TTE. The optimal imaging frequency after 
repair of CoA is not well established and is best 
individualized based on the type of repair, physical 
examination findings, and previous imaging find-
ings.27 After establishing stable aortic imaging after 
CoA repair, surveillance imaging is often obtained 
every 3 to 5 years.20,28-30 Recoarctation occurs in 
about 10%6,8 after surgical repair and about 8% 
after balloon dilation.21 After endovascular repair 
of CoA, MRI or CT can evaluate for complications, 
recoarctation, or endoleaks.2,3,11
2. Patients with a significant CoA typically have 
hypertension in the upper extremities and a reduc-
tion in BP in the lower extremities. The location of 
the CoA will inform any BP differential between

clavian artery in the case of a right-sided aortic arch). It 
courses through the posterior mediastinum behind the 
esophagus in its path to perfuse the arm and can cause 
a vascular ring around the trachea and esophagus that 
results in dysphagia, respiratory symptoms, or recur-
rent laryngeal nerve palsy. Kommerell’s diverticulum is a 
persistent remnant of the fourth primitive dorsal aortic 
arch because of failed regression3 and may be present

Tumors of the thoracic aorta are usually secondary,

malignancies, especially lung and esophageal.1,2 Primary 
malignant tumors of the aorta, which are extremely rare, 
are most often primary sarcomas that protrude into the 
lumen but leave the aortic wall intact. Aortic sarcomas 
are aggressive tumors with a propensity for arterial 
embolization, disseminated metastases, and rapid clini-
cal deterioration,3,4 usually with limited survival after initial 
diagnosis.5,6 Tumors of the thoracoabdominal aorta may 
exhibit nonspecific symptoms. On imaging, aortic tumors 
are often initially mistaken for atherosclerosis or aneurys-

metabolic activity over metabolically quiescent athero-
sclerosis), so the diagnosis is often made by histologic 
examination of embolic debris or surgical specimens8-10;

ing, patients may be unable to exercise initially at 
the recommended level.27 An intensity of 3 to 5 
metabolic equivalents of task is recommended, 
while avoiding strenuous lifting, lifting to the point 
of exhaustion, or other activities that entail maximal 
exertion.6,29 In a retrospective study, patients with 
small AAA went through a modified cardiac rehabil-
itation program before surgery, and the rate of aor-
tic growth was slower in the rehabilitation group.28
3. High-intensity athletic training in 1 study has been 
shown to be an independent predictor of aortic 
growth, although these data were limited to the 
aortic root and did not include AAA.30 In a recent 
study in 442 athletes of mean age 61 years, aortic 
root enlargement by z-score was present in 24% 
of participants and, after multivariate analysis, elite 
competitor status was found to be an independent 
predictor of aortic growth.31 Less is known about 
the potential effects of mild-to-moderate intensity 
aerobic activity on aortic growth, but it is known to improve overall cardiovascular health, includ-
ing among patients with TAA32-34 and AAA.20,35,36 
A recent meta-analysis suggests that that higher 
physical activity is associated with a reduced risk 
of AAA.37 In 1 study of a mouse model of Marfan 
syndrome, rates of aortic root growth were signifi-
cant slower in mice that exercised daily on a tread-
mill compared with sedentary mice.38 In another 
study of mice with Marfan syndrome, both mild and 
moderate—but not strenuous—aerobic exercise 
protected the structural integrity of the aortic wall, 
as evidenced by reduced elastin fragmentation and 
reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinases 2 
and 9 within the aortic wall, compared with seden-
tary controls.39
4. Depression and anxiety often occur in patients 
with aortic disease, regardless of surgical status. Posttraumatic stress disorder after dissection is 
a particular risk.8 Screening patients and provid-
ing resources for assistance may prevent mental 
health issues from becoming more severe and 
lead to an increased HRQOL.9,40 The SF-36 is a 
common tool for assessing mental health for these

cerns, such as activity restriction, family life, and 
losing ability to earn income.16 More studies are 
needed with both pre- and postoperative HRQOL 
data to improve shared decision-making and 
patient outcomes.12,13,41 Exercise may decrease 
depression.9 Education before procedures helps 
most patients feel more satisfied with their pro-
cedures16 and improve postoperative HRQOL.41

Screening for AAA among men ≥65 years of age has 
been shown to be cost-effective,2,3 although data for 
screening women are less clear. Women have a lower 
incidence of AAA but higher risk of rupture and longer 
life expectancy, so incremental cost-effectiveness is sim-
ilar to men and may justify screening, especially in those 
with a history of smoking.4
In patients with AAA, studies comparing EVAR to 
open surgical repair generally show lower initial costs for 
EVAR based on shorter hospital stays; however, ongoing 
expenses for EVAR surveillance and reinterventions may 
minimize long-term cost advantages after 2 to 5 years.5-9

tions and countries, and changing efficiencies in tech-"
